# Lab-4-Exercise-2

I implement an observer pattern to play audio when the cube touches the sphere. When the player's move Script tigger the Audio Manager, it will play audio.
I also create two singletons one for the source which will increase when "player touch the sphere", and the other for the "Sphere Health" which decrease when "enemy touch the sphere".
